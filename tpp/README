#The Pirate Bible

The Pirate Bible fetches Bible content from http://old.bibelselskabet.dk/danbib/web/bibelen.htm.

Since I can't fetch the data directly, i use Yahoo YQL to fetch it for me.

The application lets the user navigate through the Danish Bible.

The routing is made with backbone, and the DOM manipulations are made with jQuery.  

The application stores a local copy of each chapter it has accessed in the local WEBSQL database, thus easing the load on Yahoo YQL, and enabling offline access.
